🐾 Bloodhound

Bloodhound is a lightweight, GUI-based cybersecurity tool for ethical network reconnaissance. Built with Python and Tkinter, it features live packet sniffing, port scanning, and alert mechanisms for suspicious services — all wrapped in a hacker-style console interface.

🚀 Features

🎯 Target IP Selection: Easily set the IP address to scan.

📡 Port Scanner: Scans a user-defined port range and identifies open ports.

⚠️ Suspicious Port Alerts: Flags potentially dangerous services (e.g., RDP, Telnet, SMB).

📶 Packet Sniffer: Captures and logs live network packets using scapy.

📝 Packet Summary Logging: Automatically saves protocol stats to a .txt file.

💻 Hacker-Themed Interface: Choose between dark or light terminal-style themes.

🔊 Optional Sounds: Play alert or startup sounds to enhance feedback.

🧪 How to Use
Start App: Launch the Python script.

Set Target: Use “Enter Target IP” to define your scan destination.

Scan Ports: Run a scan across a specified range.

Sniff Packets: Start/stop packet capture to log live traffic.

View Results: See console-style logs and suspicious port alerts.

Save Summary: Export protocol stats after sniffing stops.
